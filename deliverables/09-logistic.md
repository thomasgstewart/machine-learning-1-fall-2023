Suppose death at 6 months is the primary endpoint.

1. What is the parameter budget for this endpoint?  (See Table 4.1 of the textbook.)
1. Construct a model of death at 6 months follow-up, incorporating baseline factors: age, sex, and various measures of disease severity.  Include treatment.  Be sure to consider nonlinear associations and interactions.
1. Generate figures of model diagnostics.
1. Generate figures of model calibration and a table of model performance measures.
1. Generate the table of standard hypotheses.
1. Generate a partial effect plot for one of the predictors in the model.
1. Make a conclusion about the effectiveness of aspirin as a treatment with respect to the primary endpoint.
1. (Optional) refit the model with a prior.
