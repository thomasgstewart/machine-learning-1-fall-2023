Appendix A Exercises
========

1. Write an R function that takes a matrix as input and returns an orthonormal basis of the column vectors.  Write the function in a way so that any linearly dependent column vectors are returned as zero vectors in the appropriate column.  (I know there are already commands that perform this function ... I want you to code up the procedure yourself.)

2. Use the function created in 1 to answer the following exercises in the Christensen text: A.6, A.7, A.8, A.10, A.11, A.12, A.13
